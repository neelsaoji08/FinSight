       "'Stay in the loop every day with Yahoo Finance\\'s free Fully Briefed newsletter. Renewed political tensions between the U.S. and China — which came to light this week as the Biden administration sat down with their Chinese counterparts for the first time to discuss a range of issues — could ensnarl vehicle maker Tesla (TSLA), which has pushed successfully into China in recent years. In fact, the heightened rhetoric between the two super economic superpowers may have already had blowback on Elon Musk\\'s electric car company. The Chinese government is restricting the use of Tesla vehicles by military staff and employees of vital state-owned companies, The Wall Street Journal reported Friday. Chinese officials reportedly have concerns that Tesla\\'s cars — outfitted with various data collecting capabilities — could serve as leakers of national security secrets. \"I have been saying for months now that Tesla\\'s level of integration of their business, of their research, of their sort of geo-tracking for which there is integration with Chinese maps, their development of A.I. with Chinese firms, and electric battery technology that\\'s not sustainable in China given the trajectory [on policy] that we are now on,\" policy expert and Eurasia Group founder Ian Bremmer said on Yahoo Finance Live. \"Most American A.I. and technology companies are seen as critical for national security, they don\\'t have access in China — companies like Amazon, Google and Facebook. Tesla is the outlier.\" That outlier status has made China an incredibly important market for Tesla, and a key part of the investment thesis in the stock. Tesla\\'s sales in China clocked in at $6.66 billion in 2020, up 123% from a year earlier powered by strength in the Model 3. The business made up about 21% of Tesla\\'s overall 2020 sales. Tesla began deliveries of its China-made Model Y to Chinese consumers earlier this year. Bremmer warns Tesla now has a challenging road ahead in China in light of the recent development by the military. Musk\\'s response to the Chinese actions are important for investors to watch, suggests Bremmer. \"At a moment of some white knuckle tensions between the U.S. and China, Musk & Co. find themselves in a unique position (along with Apple) of being caught in the crossfire,\" Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives said. Tesla shares fell about 2% on the report, as investors pondered if China will take a harder line on Tesla\\'s sales to'"

       "  '(Bloomberg) -- In the wild, speculative ride known as GameStop Corp., traders are about to get a real-world dose of data when the video-game retailer reports earnings next week. Whether the results justify the company’s $14 billion market value is another issue entirely. While shares of the Grapevine, Texas-based company have given back a huge chunk of this year’s 2,460% gain after hitting a record intraday high of $483 in late January, they’re still up better than 900%, closing Thursday at $201.75. Skeptics are warning amateur investors who piled into the stock that this remnant of their euphoria could still come crashing down. “The current valuation far exceeds our high fundamental expectations and projected multiyear benefits from the transformation,” wrote Telsey’s Joseph Feldman, one of the stock’s bearish analysts. “The company has yet to show financial success in an industry that is rapidly shifting to digital.” GameStop gave back as much as 9.5% during Friday morning trading. volatile swings have been triggered by the frenzy of Reddit-fueled retail traders and optimism surrounding a shake-up led by Chewy Inc. co-founder and activist investor Ryan Cohen. With the first quarterly update of the year set for March 23, the options market indicates that investors should expect a wild session, with an implied one-day move of roughly 24%. At Thursday’s prices, that could mean a range of about $97 a share. GameStop’s market value soared to $33.7 billion, making it briefly the largest company in the Russell 2000, before tumbling to $2.68 billion and then recovering as a new wave of investors rushed in. A short squeeze may have fueled January’s rally, with bets against 140% of the shares available for trading. Since then, short interest as a percentage of the float has plummeted to 14%. Some of Wall Street’s marquee names came out on top, with Bill Gross, the billionaire investor and co-founder of Pacific Investment Management Co. better known for bonds, saying he made $10 million betting against the company. GameStop has been shunned by Wall Street for the better part of the past four years and remains unloved by analysts.',\n",
       "  \"Stay in the loop every day with Yahoo Finance's free Fully Briefed newsletter. Wall Street’s GameStop saga won’t stop. After weeks of going dormant, shares of GameStop (NYSE:GME) have suddenly shot higher again, rising 18.6 per cent Thursday after surging 75 per cent in the last hour of trading Wednesday. Thursday’s gain, which topped 101 per cent before shrinking, came even as most stocks across Wall Street fell sharply on worries about rising interest rates. The moves are reminiscent of the shocking 1,625 per cent surge for GameStop in January, when bands of smaller and novice investors communicating on social media launched the struggling video game retailer’s stock. That initial supernova heightened questions about whether the broader market was in a bubble and whether a new generation of traders should be able to take full advantage of the free trades available on their phones. Global markets swooned momentarily; US Congress held a hearing. No clear reason seems to be behind this most recent move, leaving market observers to grasp at what little news is out there, but it does demonstrate the increased power that regular investors suddenly have. One major piece that drove last month’s surge is not as big a player this time around: a huge build-up of what’s called “short interest,” or bets by investors that the stock is set to fall. After short-selling funds got badly burned by last month’s sudden surge, many fewer GameStop shares are being sold short now. That means this pop may not reach last month’s heights. “It’s like dropping a ping-pong ball on the table,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. “The first bounce is the greatest while subsequent bounces are a bit more muted. We’re still getting a bounce, but it’s probably not going to drive up GameStop to US$500 a share.” Kitty roars again The most influential GameStop-backer may be Keith Gill, a colorful personality known for wearing a red headband and cat-themed T-shirts. He’s given regular updates of his GameStop holdings on Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum, going back to when a share cost just US 85 cents in\",\n",

       "  \"Stay in the loop every day with Yahoo Finance's free Fully Briefed newsletter. GameStop (GME) has already had quite the week, up almost 80% since Monday following news that board member and investor Ryan Cohen would play a key role in the business’s e-commerce strategy. Bulls expect the presence of Cohen, who founded pet goods retailer Chewy, to help the company fulfill the potential GameStop fans believe it has as it transforms from a brick-and-mortar focused business to something more modern. The GameStop bulls who see the company as an underrated, long-term value play may not be paying that much attention to the moves of the stock, but it’s hard to miss the roller-coaster ride. As the stock spiked on Wednesday, short interest continued to fall, perhaps after short-sellers learned their lesson in the late January squeeze, losing billions. But according to Ihor Dusaniwsky of analytics firm S3 Partners, the short squeeze will continue. “We should see the GME short squeeze continuing and more short covering in the stock as mark-to-market losses mount,” he told Yahoo Finance late Wednesday. “But as the stock continues its rapid climb, there will be short sellers waiting in the wings looking for entry points if this rally loses steam and GME’s stock price retraces.” Short interest may have fallen, but it’s still significant: $2.76 billion with 11.18 million shares shorted, 20.52% short interest percent of float or 17.02%, depending on how you calculate it, according to Dusaniwsky. (S3 prefers the latter, as it doesn’t count the synthetic longs created from a short sale. If this is confusing, S3 has a good explainer here.) To put this into context, fellow meme stock AMC Entertainment has a short interest percentage of float of 17.32%. Tesla, another famously shorted company, is at 5.98%, and Amazon at 1.03%. “This has not been a profitable trading week for GME short sellers, after being down -$1.36 billion on Monday and Tuesday,” Dusaniwsky said. “[Wednesday’s] +7% price move added another -$202 million in additional mark-to-market losses.” All in, GameStop shorts have now lost $6.8 billion year-to-date, Dusaniwsky said. — Ethan Wolff-Mann\",\n",
       "  \"Stay in the loop every day with Yahoo Finance's free Fully Briefed newsletter. Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when GameStop (GME) reports results for the quarter ended January 2021. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates. The earnings report, which is expected to be released on March 23, 2021, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower. While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise. Zacks Consensus Estimate This video game retailer is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.46 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +15%. Revenues are expected to be $2.24 billion, up 2.2% from the year-ago quarter. Estimate Revisions Trend The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period. Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Earnings Whisper Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction). The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate.

       "  'In 2015, the Financial Times joked that RadioShack, an ailing brick-and-mortar electronics chain, should consider selling fruit baskets or turning its stores into Zumba studios to survive. The retailer had ignored the threat of e-commerce for so long that few believed it could survive. Two years later, RadioShack was virtually no more. Source: TY Lim / Shutterstock.com Today, GameStop (NYSE:GME) stock sits at a similar juncture. Since the early 2010s, GME’s top brass had treated the retailer like drunks at an open bar — doling out a princely dividend to shareholders (and stock options to themselves) while cutting reinvestment into aging stores. But then something happened: A group of retail investors, driven by Reddit’s hedge-fund-hatin’ r/WallStreetBets decided to take GME stock from $10 to $480 in a matter of weeks. The people still love GameStop! InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips This love for GameStop and disdain for Wall Street is an unusual combo. It means that, unlike RadioShack in 2015, the video game retailer still has a fighting chance. For the good of GameStop and its shareholders, Reddit investors need to finish the revolution they started. And if they do, Redditors and Chewy (NYSE:CHWY) founder Ryan Cohen can still send GME stock back to $500. Anyone who’s recently visited a GameStop store will tell you the same thing: They look old. And that’s by design. For over a decade, GameStop’s management has enriched shareholders at the expense of the firm. GameStop’s capital expenditure, the budget used to maintain its stores, peaked in 2011 at almost $200 million before getting cut in favor of larger dividends and share buybacks. Meanwhile, the company’s stores have continued to age, and layoffs have continued unabated. Yet, shareholders allowed then-CEO J. Paul Raines to maintain the course. Why? It made them money. Customers, employees and other stakeholders weren’t a priority. And after several failed acquisitions, including game developer Kongregate, GameStop’s management decided that milking the company for cash was a better bet. The firm’s blind commitment to mediocrity reached a peak at the April 2020 strategy meeting. There, GameStop management',\n",
       "  'Famed investor in GameStop Corporation (NYSE: GME), Keith Gill — also known as — Roaring Kitty — is more like Berkshire Hathaway Inc (NYSE: BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B) CEO Warren Buffett than most people might think. Here’s why. The Pudding’s Proof: Gill who goes by the handle “Deep F---ing Value” on the Reddit forum r/WallStreetBets limited his exposure to GameStop call options when the stock shot up in late January. He purchased more shares after they declined in February, according to the Wall Street Journal. GameStop shares have rallied 970.9% since 2021 began and have seen a net change of 4,715% over one year. The retailer’s shares closed 3.84% lower at $201.75 on Thursday and fell another 0.4% in the after-hours trading.

Gill’s uncanny ability to time the action would impress Buffett, as per a Bloomberg opinion piece by Tae Kim. Letting Go Of Euphoria And Despondency: Kim writes referring to a Buffett cited parable that “Mr. Market” “can swing from euphoria to despondency,” taking with it stock prices up or down based on “manic-depressive emotions” rather than on changes in a company’s fundamental business or outlook. Buffett attributes “the key to success” to exploiting this moodiness of the market and escaping getting trapped in the price action. Gill’s ability to execute GameStop trades to his profit is an illustration of this strategy. See Also: Beyond WallStreetBets, Analyst Sees GameStop Benefiting From These 3 Factors This Kitty Is A Value Investor: Buffett and Gill are akin when it comes to trading style, as per Kim. “Despite the prevailing narrative that Redditors are aggressive gambling day traders, Gill at least is more akin to an old-school value investor like Buffett when it comes to GameStop.” “Roaring Kitty” has repeatedly laid out the deeply researched investment case for the company on his YouTube channel and has been involved in the stock since the summer of 2019,” wrote Kim.

       "  '(Bloomberg) -- It wasn’t just retail traders who cashed in big during the GameStop Corp. stock mania. A legendary billionaire investor made a minor killing shorting the shares. Bill Gross, the erstwhile bond king and co-founder of Pacific Investment Management Co., said in an interview Tuesday on Bloomberg Television that he made about $10 million betting against the video game retailer’s shares. But the trade didn’t go off without a hitch. “I got in too early,” said Gross. “I was in the hole by about $10 million.” But he stuck with it to sell at a profit. GameStop stock, for months among the most heavily shorted on the New York Stock Exchange, surged more than 1,700% from Jan. 1 through Jan. 27 as a legion of Reddit users piled on, forcing bearish traders to scramble for shares and brokers to take the highly unusual step of curbing trading. Amid that mania, Gross took a shot to bet against the shares: “I got in with options like a good Robinhood trader, I guess.” He’s not done yet. “I’m still selling call options at $250 and $300,” said Gross. “I think this is the perfect opportunity for options sellers, not buyers, to take advantage.” Gross was largely known for his bond bets after four decades at Pimco, which he built into one of the world’s largest asset managers. For years he generated industry-leading returns as manager of the Pimco Total Return Fund and in 2013 the firm’s assets approached $2 trillion. He was ousted though a year later after feuding with his Pimco partners over strategy, succession and managerial control. Gross then joined Janus Henderson Group Plc as a money manager, switching his focus from pursuing relative return against a benchmark to an unconstrained strategy. The aim was to achieve positive results no matter the market conditions, but it didn’t work out. Returns were disappointing and Gross retired in March 2019. Gross continues to comment on central bank policy and deficits and speculate in the bond markets with his personal fortune. Read more: Bill Gross says he’s short Treasuries He said he',\n",

       " 'TSLA': ['Stay in the loop every day with Yahoo Finance\\'s free Fully Briefed newsletter. Renewed political tensions between the U.S. and China — which came to light this week as the Biden administration sat down with their Chinese counterparts for the first time to discuss a range of issues — could ensnarl vehicle maker Tesla (TSLA), which has pushed successfully into China in recent years. In fact, the heightened rhetoric between the two super economic superpowers may have already had blowback on Elon Musk\\'s electric car company. The Chinese government is restricting the use of Tesla vehicles by military staff and employees of vital state-owned companies, The Wall Street Journal reported Friday. Chinese officials reportedly have concerns that Tesla\\'s cars — outfitted with various data collecting capabilities — could serve as leakers of national security secrets. \"I have been saying for months now that Tesla\\'s level of integration of their business, of their research, of their sort of geo-tracking for which there is integration with Chinese maps, their development of A.I. with Chinese firms, and electric battery technology that\\'s not sustainable in China given the trajectory [on policy] that we are now on,\" policy expert and Eurasia Group founder Ian Bremmer said on Yahoo Finance Live. \"Most American A.I. and technology companies are seen as critical for national security, they don\\'t have access in China — companies like Amazon, Google and Facebook. Tesla is the outlier.\" That outlier status has made China an incredibly important market for Tesla, and a key part of the investment thesis in the stock. Tesla\\'s sales in China clocked in at $6.66 billion in 2020, up 123% from a year earlier powered by strength in the Model 3. The business made up about 21% of Tesla\\'s overall 2020 sales. Tesla began deliveries of its China-made Model Y to Chinese consumers earlier this year.

Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) was in 68 hedge funds' portfolios at the end of the fourth quarter of 2020. The all time high for this statistic was previously 67. This means the bullish number of hedge fund positions in this stock currently sits at its all time high. TSLA investors should pay attention to an increase in hedge fund interest recently. There were 67 hedge funds in our database with TSLA positions at the end of the third quarter. Our calculations also showed that TSLA isn't among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds (click for Q4 rankings). In the financial world there are a large number of tools investors have at their disposal to grade stocks. A pair of the most under-the-radar tools are hedge fund and insider trading indicators.

       "  'Delta Electronics Inc., a producer of power components for Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL), has cut its workforce in China by about half, the Financial Times reported Thursday. What Happened: Yancey Hai, Delta’s chairman, told Financial Times in an interview that the company’s target is to cut its direct labor force in China by 90 percent. Delta is a Taiwanese electronics company that manufactures power components such as cooling fans for notebook computers, solar inverters and motors for electric cars. In 2019, Delta relocated the production of telecom power equipment to Thailand and Taiwan after the U.S. imposed a 25% tax on such goods made in China as part of the trade war, according to FT. The company is now reportedly building four large factories in India to make photovoltaic inverters, industrial automation equipment, and information technology and communications gear. Why It Matters: The fallout from the U.S.-China trade war and soaring production costs in China have forced Delta and other electronic companies with strong manufacturing bases in China to relocate production to other countries in South-east Asia and India. Apple supplier Pegatron Corp. said in January that it planned to invest $150 million to set up an iPhone production facility in India. Apple had put the Taiwanese company on probation over labor violations in mainland China last November.

       "  'By David Shepardson WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. auto safety agency said on Wednesday it will send a team to investigate a crash involving a Tesla suspected of being in Autopilot mode when it struck a parked Michigan State Police patrol car. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said it was sending the Special Crash Investigation (SCI) team in line with its oversight and authority \"over the safety of all motor vehicles and equipment, including automated technologies.\" Tesla did not immediately comment. Michigan State Police said on Twitter a parked patrol car was struck at 1:12 am Wednesday, while investigating a traffic crash between a car and deer near Lansing on Interstate-96. \"While investigating that crash with their emergency lights on, a Tesla on autopilot strikes the patrol car,\" the agency said. No one was injured and the 22-year-old Tesla driver was issued traffic citations. Before this week, NHTSA previously launched at least 14 SCI teams following Tesla crashes that were suspected of being tied to its Autopilot driver assistance system. The agency has taken no action as a result of those probes. On Monday, NHTSA said it was sending another SCI team to investigate a \"violent\" March 11 crash in Detroit in which a Tesla became wedged underneath a tractor-trailer and left a passenger in critical condition. Detroit police said Tuesday they do not believe that Autopilot was in use the March 11 crash based on \"all indications.\" Autopilot has been engaged in at least three Tesla vehicles involved in fatal U.S. crashes since 2016. Concerns have grown about systems that can perform driving tasks for extended stretches with little or no human intervention, but cannot completely replace human drivers. Tesla advises drivers they must keep their hands on the steering wheel and pay attention while using Autopilot. However, some Tesla drivers say they are able to avoid putting their hands on the wheel for extended periods when using Autopilot. In February 2020, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) sharply criticized Tesla\\'s lack of system safeguards in a fatal 2018 Autopilot crash in California.

       "  '(Bloomberg) -- Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest Management expects Tesla Inc. stock to hit $3,000 by 2025, up from its current price of $655. At that price, the company would be worth almost $3 trillion, based on the number of shares outstanding. Ark expects there’s a 50% chance of Tesla achieving fully autonomous driving within five years, which could allow the company to scale its planned robotaxi service quickly, according to a Friday note on Ark’s website. It also added Tesla’s insurance business into its model, believing the offering could be rolled out to more states in the next few years with better-than-average margins, thanks to “highly detailed driving data” the company collects. Wood has been among Tesla’s most ardent supporters, holding large stakes of the company in her flagship fund. When Tesla shares saw a pullback in February, she bought more. According to Ark’s new model, in the best case scenario, Tesla could reach $4,000 per share in 2025, and in the bear case, $1,500. The company forecasts Tesla’s unit sales to be between 5 million and 10 million vehicles in 2025, assuming increased capital efficiency. The $3,000 target is far higher than any analyst who covers the company, the highest being $1,200 among estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Fueled by zealous supporters, Tesla shares rose more than 740% last year, the best performance on the S&P 500. Elon Musk, its chief executive officer, became the richest person in the world in January, before Jeff Bezos reclaimed the title.

       " 'BTC': ['Stay in the loop every day with Yahoo Finance\\'s free Fully Briefed newsletter. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) was in retreat on Monday morning after hitting a new record high over the weekend. It broke through $60,000 to reach a high of $61,674 on Saturday. The world\\'s biggest cryptocurrency was in retreat by the start of the week, down 6% to $56,366 by lunchtime in London. The price decline came amid reports that India could ban cryptocurrencies altogether, potentially cutting off one of the biggest markets in the world. Reuters reported on Sunday evening that senior government officials in India were working on a law banning cryptocurrencies. People could be penalised for mining or owning cryptocurrencies under the proposals, according to the report. The broader cryptocurrency ecosystem was in decline on Monday morning. The crypto market was down 4.5% over 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap.com. Ethereum (ETH-USD), the world\\'s second largest cryptocurrency, was trading 5.2% lower against the dollar to $1,777.37 on Monday. Nigel Green, chief executive and founder of financial advisory group deVere, said regulation was likely to become an increasing concern for bitcoin and the wider cryptocurrency market.

Unlike some of his billionaire counterparts, the Microsoft co-founder and climate activist isn\\'t a fan of the digital coin. Why? The energy required to process it is too heavy on the world\\'s resources, the self-described \"Bitcoin skeptic\" argues. \"Bitcoin uses more electricity per transaction than any other method known to mankind,\" Gates said in an interview on audio-based social network platform Clubhouse with New York Times. \"It\\'s not a great climate thing.\" But he isn\\'t against it on principle: if it isn\\'t so bad if it uses cleaner sources of power. “If it’s green electricity and it’s not crowding out other uses, eventually, you know, maybe that’s OK,” Gates added. The resource-intensiveness of Bitcoin has been documented: Bitcoin mining reportedly generates 37 million tonnes of carbon dioxide every single year. WATCH ABOVE: Why Bitcoin is so bad for the planet A recent study from Cambridge University indicated that Bitcoin uses more electricity per year than the entire country of Argentina or Norway. Other voices have also spoken against Bitcoin\\'s environmental damage, with Société Générale bank Kleinwort Hambros\\' chief investment officer describing bitcoin\\'s energy use as \"staggering\". Indeed, the process of mining a single Bitcoin isn\\'t easy and can\\'t be done on a typical laptop: it requires the might of \\'super-computers\\' that are hard at work coming up with complex computational solutions. The cryptocurrency, which skyrocketed in popularity and investment recently, is currently worth more than $73,000. Gates is well-known for his climate work, stepping down from the Microsoft board shortly after the COVID-19 pandemic struck to focus on climate challenges. He published a new book in mid-February titled \\'How to Avoid a Climate\\' which outlines his solutions for eliminating greenhouse emissions.

       "  'Over the past year, crypto mining stocks have outperformed bitcoin (BTC), and the trend has accelerated since the cryptocurrency climbed past $20,000 a few months ago, according to the financial research firm FundStrat. The dynamic might hold if bitcoin stays in a bull market, the firm predicts. “Bitcoin and the wider crypto market are the modern-age digital gold rush,” wrote FundStrat, which means crypto mining stocks could see further upside. Because “miners play such a critical role in ensuring the Bitcoin network functions properly, investors have sought opportunities to gain exposure to mining companies,” which generate revenue in the form of mined bitcoin. The largest publicly listed mining companies include Riot Blockchain (NASDAQ: RIOT), Hive Blockchain (OTCMKTS: HVBTF), and Marathon Patent Group (NASDAQ: MARA). As the bitcoin price increases, miners spin up new rigs or upgrade hardware in pursuit of higher block rewards. And FundStrat expects more-efficient mining machines will help some firms remain competitive, which could boost profit margins. But buyer beware: “Mining company equities may serve as a high-beta play on bitcoin … [and when the cryptocurrency] enters a bear cycle, we would expect mining equities to have greater downside volatility than bitcoin,” according to FundStrat.

U.S. President Joe Biden\\'s $1.9 trillion COVID Relief Bill has passed congress and stimulus checks are soon to be distributed. Early signs indicate recipients are ready to buy Bitcoin. A survey by Mizuho Securities showed that out of 235 participants who expect to receive stimulus checks from the COVID Relief Bill, 10% are interested in investing in Bitcoin. It\\'s a small sample size, but according to the survey investing in Bitcoin was a more popular response than investing in traditional stocks. If that kind of runaway popularity doesn\\'t move you in itself, consider that it could translate into $40 billion dollars running like a river directly from Biden\\'s $1.9 trillion stimulus package into Bitcoin. In the same week, Bank of America strategists suggested to Bloomberg that the price of BTC can be moved 1% for just $93 million. Bank of America strategists said in a note to Bloomberg on Wednesday: \"Bitcoin is extremely sensitive to increased dollar demand.

Bitcoin passed the $60,000 mark for the first time on Saturday, with analysts saying the giant US stimulus package helped boost the world\\'s most popular virtual currency on its record-breaking run. The cryptocurrency hit $60,197 at 1234 GMT and continued to hover around $60,000, according to the website CoinMarketCap. Bitcoin has tripled in value over the last three months -- it was worth $20,000 in December -- bolstered by increasing backing from corporate heavyweights. Markets.com analyst Neil Wilson said that in recent days \"Bitcoin went up as investors looked to the imminent arrival of stimulus cheques\". Individuals in the US earning up to $75,000 will receive a cheque for $1,400 from this weekend, after President Joe Biden signed his $1.9 trillion Covid-19 rescue plan into law this week. Bitcoin has been on a meteoric rise since March last year, when it stood at $5,000, spurred by online payments giant PayPal saying it would allow account holders to use cryptocurrency. Last month Elon Musk\\'s electric carmaker Tesla invested $1.5 billion in the virtual unit, while Twitter chief Jack Dorsey and rap mogul Jay-Z said they are creating a fund aimed at making Bitcoin \"the internet\\'s currency\". Others jumping on the bandwagon include Wall Street player BNY Mellon, investment fund giant BlackRock and credit card titan Mastercard. Bitcoin, which was launched back in 2009, hit the headlines in 2017 after soaring from less than $1,000 in January to almost $20,000 in December of the same year. The virtual bubble then burst in subsequent days, with bitcoin\\'s value fluctuating wildly before sinking below $5,000 by October 2018.

       "  \"Bitcoin’s price has nearly doubled this year, but the rally could have room to run. That’s based on a new report by Coin Metrics, a cryptocurrency data firm, which shows bitcoin (BTC) is not at an extreme relative to the previous market top in 2018. The MVRV ratio is a measure of bitcoin’s market value relative to its realized value. The gauge represents the difference between the cryptocurrency’s current price and the average price at which bitcoins were acquired. When it reaches an extreme, the thinking goes, traders might be inclined to take profits, creating sell pressure that could push price down. The near 20% bitcoin sell-off from an all-time-high around $60,000 last week triggered a decline in the MVRV ratio to 0.88. “Historically, the periods that MVRV has dropped below 1.0 have been some of the best times to invest in BTC,” according to Coin Metrics. The MVRV indicator reached an extreme around 4 in 2018, and near 6 in 2014, just prior to the start of bear markets.

       "  \"Stay in the loop every day with Yahoo Finance's free Fully Briefed newsletter. Bitcoin (BTC) appears set to challenge record highs in the wake of this week’s dovish Federal Reserve meeting. One expert, however, is calling caution, based on his observation of price charts as bitcoin rose from lows near $43,000 seen earlier this month. The chart pattern has taken the shape of what’s known as a rising wedge, a sign of uptrend fatigue. “My concern is growing that we might run into a rising wedge scenario,” Patrick Heusser, head of trading at Swiss-based Crypto Finance AG, told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat. The wedge’s support line is pretty strong, with more than four touchpoints, and that does give me some confidence, though, if we break lower through the trendline, which is when things could get ugly.” Related: Financial Watchdogs Have DeFi in Their Sights, Alter Wording Around NFTs The rising wedge comprises converging trendlines connecting higher lows and higher highs. The converging nature of the trendline indicates the waning of upside momentum. Hence, a breakdown – a move below the lower end of the rising wedge – is considered a sign of bullish-to-bearish trend change. According to Heusser, a move below $54,000 would confirm the rising wedge breakdown and open the doors for a drop to $47,000. The immediate bias will remain bullish while the wedge support is held intact. At press time, bitcoin is changing hands near $58,900, having put in lows under $56,500 early Friday, according to CoinDesk 20 data. The cryptocurrency jumped from $55,000 to $60,000 earlier this week after the Fed signaled no interest rate hike until at least 2024, pushing back against growing fears of an early unwinding monetary stimulus.

       "'Delta Electronics Inc., a producer of power components for Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL), has cut its workforce in China by about half, the Financial Times reported Thursday. What Happened: Yancey Hai, Delta’s chairman, told Financial Times in an interview that the company’s target is to cut its direct labor force in China by 90 percent. Delta is a Taiwanese electronics company that manufactures power components such as cooling fans for notebook computers, solar inverters and motors for electric cars. In 2019, Delta relocated the production of telecom power equipment to Thailand and Taiwan after the U.S. imposed a 25% tax on such goods made in China as part of the trade war, according to FT. The company is now reportedly building four large factories in India to make photovoltaic inverters, industrial automation equipment, and information technology and communications gear. Why It Matters: The fallout from the U.S.-China trade war and soaring production costs in China have forced Delta and other electronic companies with strong manufacturing bases in China to relocate production to other countries in South-east Asia and India. Apple supplier Pegatron Corp. said in January that it planned to invest $150 million to set up an iPhone production facility in India. Apple had put the Taiwanese company on probation over labor violations in mainland China last November.
